# The 2016 Simulator for BBC Micro
Using advanced simulation algorithms, I built a simulator for the annus horribilis that was 2016. You can see it in action [here](https://twitter.com/angryflatcap/status/802065968214265856)

## Setup
1. Find a BBC Micro emulator*
2. Paste in the code
3. Type RUN


\*- I used [BeebEm3 for Mac](https://www.g7jjf.com/download.htm). The latest package is from 2008, and isn't compatible with recent MacOS versions. To get around the issue, I had to: 
1. Right click on package and click 'Show Package Contents'
2. Go to Contents > MacOS
3. Double click on the BeebEm3 executable
